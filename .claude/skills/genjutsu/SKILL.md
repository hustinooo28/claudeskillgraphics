# genjutsu

The art of illusion: cast motion, paint visual signatures, summon the shadow clones. Anti-AI-slop creative coding.

This single skill bundles the three pipelines and all sub-skills.

## Picking the pipeline

**Default to `cast`.** It is the lighter pipeline and it covers the common case: something already exists and it should feel better.

Route to `paint` only on an explicit signal: "from scratch", "redesign everything", "design system", "visual identity", "brand", or a request that names nothing existing to enhance.

When the intent is genuinely ambiguous, do not spend a question on it. Run `cast` and say so in one line:

> "Running cast. Say `paint` if you want a full visual identity instead."

A `paint` that turns out to be a single component has its own shortened path (see "Light scope" in the paint pipeline), so routing upward by mistake is recoverable and cheap.

Route to `bunshin` only when the user asks for it by name ("bunshin", "the shadow clones"), or accepts it when `cast` or `paint` proposes it. It builds a whole website or web app with a team of subagents and costs millions of tokens, so it is never picked on a guess: a whole-site request without that word goes to `paint`, whose first step proposes `bunshin` when the brief and the host fit. `bunshin` steps down on its own when the request turns out smaller than a site.

## Loading it

Run the block for the pipeline you picked, in one shell call. Each block is self-contained: a fresh shell keeps nothing from the previous one, so the search is repeated rather than factored out.

Claude Code tells the block where this skill lives. On any other host, put one line in front of the block, in the same call, naming the directory you read this file from: `GENJUTSU_BUNDLE_DIR='/absolute/path/to/genjutsu'`. Without it the block searches the usual skills directories, which works but is slower.

The block prints a `GENJUTSU_SKILL_DIR=` line, then the pipeline. Keep that line: the pipeline's skill-base block needs it, copied quoted in front of the block, in the same shell call, every time. If the block reports that it could not find the bundle, stop and show the user its message: the pipelines do not work without their modules.

**cast** - enhance or animate existing UI ("add a scroll animation", "make this dropdown snappy", "polish this transition"):
